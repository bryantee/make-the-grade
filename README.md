## Purpose
This is an app I'm building to get a better grasp on the C# language and .NET development. I'm coding along side Scott Allen (@OdeToCode) using the course he developed for Pluralsight title C# Fundamentals.

I decided to [take notes during](notes/README.md) the course of writing this application. Feel free to follow along.
